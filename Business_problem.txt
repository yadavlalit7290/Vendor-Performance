Business Problem

Effective inventory and sales management are critical for optimizing
profitability in the retail and wholesale industry. Companies need to ensure
that they are not incurring losses due to inefficient pricing, poor inventory
turnover, or vendor dependency. The goal of this analysis is to:

. Identify underperforming brands that require promotional or pricing
  adjustments.
· Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit.
· Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs and improve
  efficiency.
· Investigate the profitability variance between high-performing and
  low-performing vendors.
